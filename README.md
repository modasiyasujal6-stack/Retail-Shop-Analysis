“End-to-End Retail Shop Sales Analysis using Python, SQL, and Power BI”.
🚀 Retail Shop Sales Analysis | End-to-End Data Project

Recently, I completed an end-to-end Data Analytics project where I integrated Python, SQL, and Power BI to simulate and analyze the performance of a retail shop.

🔹 Step 1: Dataset Creation

Generated a realistic dataset using Python libraries: faker, random, and datetime.

Stored the dataset into a PostgreSQL database with the help of SQLAlchemy.

🔹 Step 2: Data Preparation

Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and transformations in Python.

Practiced SQL by writing queries for data extraction, filtering, and aggregations to simulate real-world ETL processes.

🔹 Step 3: Data Modeling in Power BI

Imported cleaned data into Power BI.

Designed a data model (with both auto-detect and manual relationships) connecting key tables such as Customers, Products, Regions, Channels, Sales, Inventory, and Loyalty.

Pre-cleaned primary keys (customer_id, product_id, region_id, etc.) ensured a smooth model design.

🔹 Step 4: Dashboard & KPIs
The interactive Power BI Dashboard included:

KPIs: Total Orders, Customers, Revenue, Average Order Value, Average Rating, Total Units Sold, and Quantity Movement.

Visuals & Insights:

Sales Trends by Month/Year

Top Products by Revenue

Revenue by Sales Channel & Region

Customer Loyalty Distribution

Budget vs. Actual Spending

Category-Wise Revenue & Low Stock Products

Customer Lifetime Value

📊 Key Insights Discovered:

High contribution from top products like Throat Lozenges, Frozen Naan, Dry Anjeer.

In-Store channel generated the maximum revenue compared to Online and Mobile App.

Certain regions contributed almost equally to total sales, showing balanced performance.

Budget vs Actual revealed spending gaps in some months.

Identified low-performing and low-stock products to optimize inventory.

🔹 Step 5: Challenges & Learnings
Biggest Challenge: Generating realistic synthetic data in Python for the first time.

Learnings:

Python libraries: faker, random, datetime, sqlalchemy

Advanced SQL queries and database management in PostgreSQL

Building creative dashboards and applying DAX measures in Power BI

🔹 Step 6: Automation

Automated the entire pipeline (data generation → database update → Power BI refresh) using Windows Task Scheduler so the process runs daily without manual intervention.

💡 Takeaway: This project gave me end-to-end exposure to the data analytics lifecycle — from dataset creation → database management → ETL → visualization → automation → insights.
